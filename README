cxx-prettyprint
===============

A pretty printing library for C++ containers.

Synopsis:
  Simply by including this header-only library in your source file,
  you can say "std::cout << x" for any container object x. Sensible
  defaults are provided, but the behaviour (i.e. the delimiters) are
  compile-time customizable to a great extent via partial specializiation.

Usage:
  Just add "#include "prettyprint.hpp" to your source file and make sure
  that prettyprint.hpp is findable.

Example:
  Some usage examples are provided by ppdemo.cpp.

  Using GCC, compile with
    g++ -W -Wall -pedantic -O2 -s ppdemo.cpp -o ppdemo -std=c++0x 
    g++ -W -Wall -pedantic -O2 -s ppdemo98.cpp -o ppdemo98

For C++98/03, define "NO_TR1" to prevent any inclusion of
TR1 headers and to disable std::tr1::tuple support.
